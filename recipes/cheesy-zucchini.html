        <ul>
            <li>A large, open area</li>
            <li>Twenty-seven or more cheese, enough to fill an octagon</li>
            <li>Around eight zucchini</li>
            <li><strong>All of your free time</strong></li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

            <li>Stand in the middle of your large, open area.</li>
            <li>With salt in hand, create a line on the floor with side length of about <em>one</em> (1) zucchini.</li>
            <li>Continue to make lines of salt, creating an <em>octagonal</em> formation.</li>
            <li>Arrange the zucchinis on top of the salt, in a <em>clockwise</em> direction.</li>
            <li>Lay the cheese down in the empty, gaping space inside the octagon. <em>Make sure they are facing west.</em></li>
            <li>Sit on the bed of cheese, and let your body heat do the work for <em>thirty</em> (30) minutes, or until cheese is <em>30 degrees celsius.</em></li>
            <li>Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
